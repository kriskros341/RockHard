  IncrementalFetcher:
    data: useSwr
    error: useSwr
    api should specify 
    offset & count in query
      Component will wrap content cutter
      if it doesn't then entire content can be prefetched

      how do I specify endpoint?
        with simple {string} regex schema, like
          http://somePage.lol/:count:/:offset:
          http://somePage.lol?count=:count:&offset=:offset:
          Select between : and : 
          
          https://somePage.lol:2137?count=:count:&offset=:offset: // How do I deal with that?

          Web url api to exclude pathname


      how do I know if there aren't more records in database? 
        if lastest fetch is empty => No more data avaliable
      
      What if something goes wrong?
        SWRerror => Something went wrong (Server Was Rude)

      What exactly are children of this component??!
        The children are specified by higher component
          How do I do that
            The child schema is passed as {(props) => <ChildComponentSchema ...props ...additionalInfo />}
      
  the result is either count of slashes from left or query key
    pathnamePositionModel | queryKeyModel
